# -GeFace
Project work for the subject 'Deep Learning in Practice with Python and LUA' at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BUTE).

Participants:

<br>Örkény H. Zováthi (@zovathio)

# Requirements
Python 3.5 (at least)

# Declaration of goal
Our goal is to construct an intelligent system which is able to predict the age (and gender) of people from a single image using Convulutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We are also interested deeply in the egsistence of any visible features which can represent the aging on the face - like the growth rings on trees for example.

# Literature overview
Age estimation is still an open and unsolved task in today's life. ALthoguh, in the past few years a lot of different approaches were created and presented.

# Problems that can be solved with correct age estimation:

Without limitation, a few problems that are also our motivation for choosing such a difficult task.

* Determine the age of people with undocumented birth.
* Measuring the avarage age of audience in presentations, advertisements, etc..
* More examples in progress...
